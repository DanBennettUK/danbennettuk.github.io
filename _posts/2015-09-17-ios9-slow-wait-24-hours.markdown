# Give it up to 24 hours...

I know, it sounds a bit silly. But on most iOS major release, a lot will update, migrate, and index in the background.
This means Battery and Performance will take a temporary hit.

Just give it some time. And if need be, use the new "Low Power" mode to try and save some power.

I'd always advise to update at night. Once the update has worked, leave it plugged in and go to bed. Most the time, it's finished by the time you wake up.
