# Why is thinking of a logo so hard?!

A logo is your identity. Your visual representation that people will see before they realize who they're looking at.

It gives a lot of information about you. But how can I get it right?!

The one I've currently got ![logo](http://dan-bennett.me/assets/images/logo.png) is, let's be honest... a bit crap.

I had this idea of it being audio related. using my initials in a way to also mean decibel (*cringe*) and kind of sound waves coming out the sides.

The other trouble is the colors... It needs to stand out, be unique... But also look good.

Blue and Orange are my favorite colors. But - they just don't sit right. Or at least, not in the way they are in the logo right now...

Gah! All it really says is about me is "Try hard, but not quite a thing". Which may be more accurate than I realize...
