### 3D Touch is amazing. 

It's such a little addition but with such a big advantage for power users. It is essentially a *right click* for the iPhone. 

So many apps are implementing it well. Quick shortcuts to things within the app. However, I do feel Apple missed a trick out here ...

Apps can only interact for the user when they are open. This makes sense. But with 3D Touch, it would make sense if apps could show a modal window on screen.

For example, Tweetbot. If I 3D Touch on the app I get a shortcut to post a new tweet. Pressing this will load the app then take me to the New Tweet screen. 

However, surely this would be better if pressing New Tweet would just load up their own custom New Tweet modal window on the Home Screen. This way, you don't leave the place you're at and it goes away once you've sent that tweet. A great replacement for the - now missing - Post Tweet widget in the Notification Centre. 

Apple, pls?
