# It was only a matter of time...
Apple have announced the Apple Pencil, which is their own Stylus for the newer, bloody big, iPad Pro.

Twitter was full of storm, mostly quoting old Steve Jobs during the original iPhone announcement stating;

> "Who wants a stylus?" ... "You have to get 'em, put 'em away, you lose 'em. Yuck! Nobody wants a stylus. So let's not use a stylus."

And yes, for the iPhone this is correct. And for the most part, this was correct for the iPad.
But as more people were using the iPad, finding ways to incorporate it into their lives, it became obvious a stylus can actually be useful...

### Not just any Stylus

For Apple to include a stylus, they had to make it work properly. This is the Apple way. They don't just take something that already exists. They completely rebuild it into something better.

The main reason the stylus has only come from Apple now, is because it's now at a point (pun intended?) where they have developed the technology to make it work with almost zero latency for drawing.

That was the main problem with a stylus. It's slower. With a finger you don't mind it, you mostly tap. You hardly even notice it. But once you start typing, or drawing, the latency was obvious and a constant battle.

### iPad Pro Only... For now.

The only reason the Apple Pencil only works for the iPad Pro is because, in true Apple fashion, the Pencil and the iPad talk to each other. iPad Pro screen refresh rate is increased dramatically for using the Pencil to help with the latency. Likewise, they both have to know and talk to each other as quick as possible.

Both the iPad and Pencil have to work together to make it work properly. This is not something that was possible with a 3rd party stylus.

Yes, for a long time now you can buy a stylus that allows for pressure and sends that data via Bluetooth, but the delay is still there and it's painful.

Now? That pain has gone.

It's only a matter of time until the iPad Air and iPad Mini are refreshed to work with the Apple Pencil. And hopefully, that time isn't too far away...
