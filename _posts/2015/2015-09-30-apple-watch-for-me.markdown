#The most expensive watch I've ever bought...
It's weird. I grew up hating watches or infact anything on my wrist. It always bugged me. Bracelets, watches, those stupid paper bands you get at gigs (OK those I still hate. Fabric ones are the best)...

But this year I chose to get a Fitbit Flex. I wanted something that was accurate for step counting and I could just keep on. It would just be part of my life, not interupt it in any way. And it was great. I found myself walking more, forcing myself to take walks at lunch during work...
But then it died. And so I decided to get an Apple Watch.

I was always considering an Apple Watch. And infact, I was fighting myself to stop me buying one. But once my FItbit died, I started considering it more. And my final choice was "Try it for 14 days. If I don't like it within those two weeks, I can get a refund"... So I got my card out and bought one.

I bought the 32mm Apple Watch Sport. The cheapest of the bunch. And the silver one. The 32mm was a good shout, fits perfectly on me. The other was just far too big!

## WatchOS2

When I first started, WatchOS2 was already available for developers. So right away I installed it and got the benefits of some of the features. But my main thing I love about it is that it's kept me active and actually hasn't been as in the way as I expected. In fact, it's been more useful.

The nightstand function in WatchOS2 is brilliant for those of us that don't have an alarm clock. I do now have an alarm clock, because I really wanted to listen to The Chris Moyles Show on Radio X in the mornings.... but the clock on that is lit up so bright it's annoying. So I still use the watches clock!

## Walk, fat boy.

My main way to keep fit is just walking. I like walking. I also don't walk normal speed, I walk slightly faster than everyone (or incredibly fast if I'm in a shopping centre. Bugger me people walk so bloody slow!).

The watch would monitor this, give me silly awards for doing so. It's nice. 

It also forces me to try take more breaks during work. "Stand up for a minute every hour" is the recommendation. Now, that's difficult to do because sometimes I just far too busy to do that. But where possible, I do. And I think it's helped my productivity a lot. Maybe it's in the mind I don't know... but it has.

It's also quite interesting to find out just how much I've done in a day. Some days I'll be active but feel like I've done nothing. The Activity app reminds me that actually, there's a very good reason why my legs are aching...

## Notifications

This was my big concern. Would I get frustrated at being notified about everything when I can easily ignore them?

No.

See, you can choose what you get notified by. And you can customise the notifications so they are different to your phone.

Your phone notifications will always appear if they do not have a WatchOS equiv. But normally these are minor things that I don't pay attention to anyway so I've just ended up turning them off so they only appear in Notification Centre.

For other notifications, such as Tweets, Messages, Facebook, Email... I have them customized so it gives me a little tap and if I want to look at it I will.

The slight downside, is the tap for Messages is a lot less than the tap for Tweets. So Messages I seem to miss more, but actually I care more about Messages. If I get a text, I want to at least glance at it. But I find I seem to occasionally not realise I've been tapped. That needs to be changed...

But for the most part, I've worked out what I don't need to be notified about and I can turn them off.

Take email. If it's an email that comes through I can easily Archive it from the notification, or just put my wrist down and leave it for later.
Same for Messages. If it's a message I can easily reply to with a word or an answer to a question, I'll do that right from my watch. If it requires more attention then I can leave it for a bit and I've set it to remind me up to 3 times. If I'm too busy, it'll just wait until I can pick my phone up.

That said though, if you do respond from your phone, the answers do come across a bit rude. I'd advise thinking of redoing them to suit the way you talk to everyone. Sometimes saying just "Yes" will make people think something is wrong. Nothing is wrong, I'm just multitasking like a mad man!

## Games

There's a few games for the Watch, but I've not really bothered with them. It's not a gaming device... 

Trivia Crack is good - well - craic... But meh. Games stick to the phone.

## Strap on! Strap off!

The Apple Watch straps are... quite frankly, overpriced. Massively. So I've looked a lot into Third Party ones.

I have a nice third party Leather Loop strap. It's pretty close to the official, except if you look closely it doesn't fully match. Now normally, this'll bug me. But for the price - not so much... 

I've tried the Milanese Mesh strap but found it would always pick at my hairs on my arms. so I've stuck with the Leather Loop. If I were out in the sun and knew I would be sweaty, I'd go back to the official Sport strap that came with my watch. But for now, the Leather Loop wins.

## Sleep Tracking

One of the things I loved about my Fitbit Flex was it'd monitor my sleep. The Apple Watch can do that, there are apps that do this. However, that requires you to wear it... yet I use it in the day, so the battery would die whilst I'm asleep...

There are ways you can do it, if you change your behaviour. However - that's not possible for me. So I'm no longer tracking my sleep which seems a bit anti-monitor-health-constantly-you-lazy-bastard-y.

## Battery

The Apple Watch is the kind of watch you wear in the day and take it off when you sleep. So, a typical watch really. Except when you take it off to sleep, you charge it.

I've not had any issue with the battery running low in the day (apart from a bug during WatchOS2 Beta's...). I normally take it off charge around 8:15am and I put it back on charge at around 23:00... Normally there's still ~50% battery left!

In heavy use (lots of walking, for example) this can get lower, but I've only really got it to the 30% mark. The only time I've really used the Power Reserve mode is  when I pretty much showing it off all day and playing with it. Once you get over the "OOOHHH SHINY SHINY" moments, it's grand. Quite frankly - battery is a non-issue.

## Worth it?

Always, the price of Apple products is never really *worth it*. But at the same time, you are paying for a premium made product. And actually, some watches that do less than the Apple Watch cost over Â£1000!! So in a way, it's a bargain!

If you're into looking at keeping fit and you're always active on your phone - I say go for it. This'll help with both and actually get some of your social life back when you're out at events.

If you need a new watch - Just buy a watch.

## Overall...

I'm loving it. It's just a nice watch that lets me know if I've been a good boy or a lazy sod. I can keep an eye on the important stuff and leave the non-vital stuff to when I can use my phone.

The only downside? I wish I got the Space Grey version...
