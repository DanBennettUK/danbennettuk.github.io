# And why the whole debate is dumb...

It's strange how even to this day, the iOS vs Android debate continues...

Everyday there is some sort of debate going on about why iOS is better than Android or vice versa.

But, why? Why does it matter what device someone is using? And why do you care?

Why can't you just let them make up their own mind?
>"I'm saving them money"

In your opinion. For them it might turn to be a costly mistake because what you think is best turns out not best for them.

>"People on iOS/Android are stupid"

Who are you to state the mental capacity of another person?

>"Don't join the iSheep"

Using a device you're comfortable with doesn't mean you're a "sheep" or a "fanboy". Likewise, you cannot call someone a "fanboy" if it's their first device or if they simply don't care...

>"You can do more on iOS/Android"

You can do the same.

>"You can customize more on iOS/Android"

They both have their own ways of customization. It's up to the user how much they want to customize it and whether the available options work for them.
