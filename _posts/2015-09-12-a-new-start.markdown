# Welcome!

So it's that time again where I decide I need to rebuild this website and get cracking with posting.

I've decided that the theme is, quite simply, "The Brain Dump".
I want a place that I can just use to post my thoughts on particular articles or subjects, as well as the ability to give informational posts. So hopefully this will be it!

I wanted to keep it simple looking. Kind of "Medium"-esqe...

### Goodbye, Wordpress!
I've decided I've had enough of Wordpress and it's complete pain in the arseness. It was bloated, slow, painful to hack to how I want it and... gah. I just got fed up.
I was never happy with how it looked or ran. Probably mostly because I'm not a designer, to be fair...

So...

### Welcome, Jekyll!
Jekyll is a wonderful little blogging system which relies on Markdown for it's posts. Each post is just a simple text file. No more databases!

The other plus I've found about Jekyll is it's very easy for me to develop and draft stuff, without it affecting the live site!

If you're thinking of moving from Wordpress, or would like to use something that requires more backend tinkering and less stumbling through awful UI/UX - then [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is for you!
(Oh - and it's Open Source!)

### The theme? Gaya!

The sites look and feel is based on an open source template called '[Gaya](https://github.com/gayanvirajith/gaya)'. Obviously, it's by this time completely different. But there you go! It was the closest beginning template to what I wanted to achieve in my mind!

So... Let's see what happens with this. Do I fail and stumble? Or do I come out shining? There's only one way to find out ...
