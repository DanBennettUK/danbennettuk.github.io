Isn’t it strange, how one simple tick can make a person seem above everyone else?

I get why it’s used. It’s to help establish the real “Celebrities” from the parody/fake accounts. But the first statement that explains what the Verified Badge is makes it sound like everyone should be able to get the tick if they can prove they are who they say they are

>“Any account with a blue verified badge on their Twitter profile is a verified account.”

Great! Let me access it!

>“Verification is currently used to establish authenticity of identities of key individuals and brands on Twitter.”

Oh — so I’m not famous enough?

>“Please note that follower count is not a factor in determining whether an account meets our criteria for verification.”

Oh — so it’s about how famous I am in real life? No, that can’t be right. Upcoming artists (as an example) seem to get verified quite quickly before even having their first big hit…

>“We concentrate on highly sought users in music, acting, fashion, government, politics, religion, journalism, media, sports, business and other key interest areas.”

It’s strange. To get a verification tick you have to be a well known somebody in the world. Yet getting that verification tick helps you get more well known. So surely it’s a good idea to let people who are independent in these areas get a tick, too?

I had a strange conversation once, where someone found my music from Soundcloud and wanted to find me on Twitter. They tweeted me asking if this Soundcloud was me and I responded yes. They then said they weren’t sure because I don’t have a tick…

So I can’t have a tick because I’m not famous or signed. Yet people may not be finding me fully because I don’t have a tick.

I mean, I make it quite easy for everyone anyway. I use my real name for everything and no matter what genre I make music wise. Yet somehow, there’s still a chance that someone will see my name think “That’s not him, he’s not got a tick”.

I’m a real person guys and girls. Honest!

On top of this, what seems to be happening recently is that everyone wants the tick and get upset when one person does and they don’t.

YouTube for example is another place that has started doing Verified Accounts. Which is great! But… there’s no real outline to who can get it or how.

>“Why do you have a tick when you have less subs than me???”

It’s getting a bit silly, really. With social media being so engrained in everyone's lives now. Surely it’s better to allow everyone to have the chance and be verified? Whether they’re an artist, YouTuber, gamer, blogger, writer, or even generic Joe from number 18 down the road…

The separation between online and offline lives is narrower than ever…Scary. But awesome at the same time.
