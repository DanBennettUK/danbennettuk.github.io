## Moodle 3.0 is coming!

For the release of 3.0, I've noticed a few things that are coming which I've highlighted in the linked post.

Considering it's a milestone release (2.x to 3.x), there's nothing that *amazing*... but hey.

I had a lovely little line about the use of "tonnes" in this post. But it got removed. I hate* editors :(

`*I joke`
