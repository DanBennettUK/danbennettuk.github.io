## There's a very strange thing about this

I'm always one that thinks that any complaint of rape needs proper proof and facts on both sides. It should never be a "She said this so he is guilty" sort of affair. Ever.

However, this case is very interesting… Kesha's goal isn't go cause a guy to go to prison. It's the fact, on her part, that she is not comfortable or scared to work with this guy.

One of the reasons in which the case was thrown out is that it's a "commercially sensitive" situation and it "wouldn't be commercially viable" for the judge to allow Kesha to escape her contract so that she doesn't have to work with this guy.

And that's the part that pisses me off.

In what sense of any world would it be OK for a judge to tell someone, who is scared and has expressed their view against a person that they are being forced to work with - that they *have* to work with them?!

Dr Luke (Luckas Gottwald) denies all alegations. And that's fine - that is his right and it's not fair on anyone to say that he is lying and she isn't. It's not a case of "he said she said".

But if someone gives indication that they are not comfortable working with someone and expresses situations to what has led to this feeling - in what mind can anyone be in to say "Tough shit, you're working with him because you have this to do in this contract".

It's not right at all for someone to be ***forced*** to work with someone when they have expressed concern for their safety or health. At all.

Kesha is in a contract in which she *has* to write a number of albums with this label and with Dr Luke. She cannot escape this contract due to the deal of the contract that was signed when she was younger.

All Kesha has now - is to either do this and make music she doesn't enjoy because it has this burden on her. Or she can not do this and be fined for not completing the contract. And that fine can be hefty.

The music business is a mad thing. Some people end up in ridiculous situations that in any other business would be classed as illegal and inhuman. Surely it's about time people look in to the kind of contracts that are being signed?

(And don't get me started on the people who advocate their "acts" taking drugs so they can tour more… *<sigh/>*)

Whether Kesha's statements are true or not. If she is scared to work with someone for her safety and welbeing - surely that comes way before commercial viableness...

Grrr!
