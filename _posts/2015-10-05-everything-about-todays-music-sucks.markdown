#Does anyone write their own music anymore?

Of all the popular massive hits in the UK and America, how many of them are written by the artist themselves? Just that artist. No one else.

I've always thought it was rare to see an artist do that, which is one of the reasons I love new up and coming artists. Because at least they made the effort. 

Reading that article shows how sad a state pop music is in right now. Grand for the song writers, mind...

Dont't get me wrong. There's nothing wrong with writing a song for someone else to sing because maybe you can't or doesn't interest you. But when it turns into a fucking factory, that is taking the piss. 

> "For Rihanna, “A-list producers and topliners [the term for vocal melody writers] were summoned to Los Angeles for two weeks and installed in studios around the city,” creating what Seabrook calls “a pop-up hit factory.”"

So instead of Rihanna going "I'm going to write an album", a *factory* was made in which people write a bunch of songs, throw them around and the best of the bunch are then hers? eh?!

> Rihanna’s next album, “Rated R,” was a commercial and critical success, and its only No. 1, “Rude Boy,” emerged from the LA camp sessions. The song is credited to five different writers(if we count the two-man Stargate team as one entity), including Dean, who wrote the hooks; Rihanna herself, who wrote the bridge with Makeba Riddick; and Stargate and Rob Swire, who created the beats.

5 people wrote "Rude Boy". 5 people.

Have you heard Rude Boy? If not, you don't even need to. The [Lyrics](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rihanna/rudeboy.html) themselves speak for my disgust. The longest line is 5 words!!!! That's one word per person. 

*I suppose to Rihanna's credit, after being beaten by Chris Brown she probably struggled to think, so the fact she wrote the bridge is amazing... /s*

> Stargate and Dean would become frequent collaborators, with hits such as Katy Perry’s “Firework” on their résumé.

Even Katy Perry couldn't come up with lyrics such as "Do you ever feel like a plastic bag"?! 

> Martin has played a pivotal role in Katy Perry’s career, co-writing and/or producing hits including “I Kissed a Girl,” “California Gurls,” and “Teenage Dream.”

So Katy didn't write anything. Did she do anything? At all?

> His three most recent No. 1 songs came from Taylor Swift’s blockbuster release, “1989” — “Shake It Off,” “Blank Space” and “Bad Blood.”

WHAT?! Even the beloved Taylor Swift, who I often thought of as genuine, doesn't write all her own shit? Agh!

# Once you succeed, you no longer need to bother

It's funny in a way. There are people out there who write their own music, produce their own songs and some of them write the best piece of fucking music imaginable. Yet they still have a job just to be able to pay for them to do the thing they love.

What? Once you've had a hit are you no longer required to try? 

Sure, writing an album can take a long time. But it's meant to. It's a craft and an art that has to go through a process that involves sweat and tears. It's should not be a case of some one going "Here's 18 songs, we record tomorrow and the album is released next month".

Where are the real musicians? The ones that, when they sing a song they sing it because they wrote it and it means something to them and comes from the heart?

Oh, they're too busy struggling to get noticed because they don't have people throwing deals at them so money can be made... and that's a rant for another day...
