# Not separated into different apps...

iTunes is vast. You can listen to music, watch video, podcasts, movies, radio, stream, catch up on your latest artists... It's all there in one big combined application. It's one big thing. 

Though I understand why people say "iTunes should be separated into different apps". But separating isn't the answer. Redesigning is. 

## Redesign!

The biggest problem really is since Apple Music was introduced. It seems more of an after thought. As if, they designed Apple Music separately then whacked it into iTunes at last minute...

The whole music and video aspect of iTunes can easily be tidied up. *I say easily, I'm not a big designer I haven't made a mock up.* They should be integrated together so it's seem less. Easy to use and with a simple opt in to benefit from the streaming part. 

iTunes Store and Apple Music also need integrated together. Find something you like? Buy it! Not sure? Keep streaming! *Or am I the only one that does this?*.

Radio needs massively improved. Beats 1 needs to take centre stage with it clearly showing scheduled and past shows that can be *relistened* to. Because boy oh boy that's a faff and a half!

I get why Apple Music came in and made people go *"WTF get this off my iTunes"* but separating will just make it worse.
