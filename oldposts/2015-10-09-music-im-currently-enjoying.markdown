I've currently found myself listening to a strange mix of stuff now. However, here's some new things I'm listening to. (I say new, new to me...)

All links direct you to Apple Music.

## Lauren Aquilina
This beautiful & beautifully voiced soul has a new EP out. If you know me, you'll know I love her anyway. But either way - the new EP is called 'Ocean' and is the newest single for her debut album which is coming.......soon......ish.....!

It has a B-Side (who even does B-Sides anymore?!) called 'Low' which is just as beautiful. Another track called 'Out Of Our Depth' and three remixes, including a remix of 'Ocean' by Arty! Oooh! Arty farty!

Go check out her god-damned EP on [Apple Music](https://itun.es/gb/jGYZ9) and if you love it just as much as I do, hit that buy button!

## The Staves
I am so damn slow at finding these beauts. They've recently supported Florence & The Machine on her last tour which is where I fell in love with them. Don't ask me why I was at a Florence gig... though I will admit it was awesome.

Anyway... Another softy softy kinda band. But beautiful and chilling. 'Blood I Bled', 'No Me, No You, No More', 'Let Me Down' and 'Make It Holy' being my 4 fave tracks from their latest album 'If I Was'. [Check it out!](https://itun.es/gb/02MS3)

## DaRude
Nope, I'm not trolling. He is indeed alive and has a brand new album called 'Moments' which is *awesome*!.

The first track however, is a troll. It literally has about 50 'Sandstorm' elements. But it's a brilliant track and the album is wonderful. Get yer glowsticks out and [play it loud](https://itun.es/gb/Fcoe9).

## Honorable Mention | Gammer - "I'm Old Now... WTF Happened?"

This album is full of classic amazing wonderful Gammer tunes. From back in the day all the way to now. Some of his best work is on here.

Likewise, some of his best collaborations.

If you're a UK Hardcore fan, you will already have this. If you don't, you should! And if you're not, you should still give it a try!

[You can purchase the album from Music Mondays. Enjoy!](https://musicmondays.databeats.com/cd/mmcd011)
