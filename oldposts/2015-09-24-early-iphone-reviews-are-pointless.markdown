# How can you review something after a day?
A day is not enough time to spend with the device.

Every device is different, internally or externally. iPhone or Android.
When you get a new device, you have to learn it. Spend some time with it and see if it still suits the way you work... You cannot do this after one day.

Especially with the iPhone 6s/6s Plus. It has a new feature that drastically changes how you work. You cannot see if this fits in your life after one day (or some, even less). It's stupid.

If you're thinking of buying the new iPhone, or any new device that has just been released - wait for a week or so. Give people time to make their actual thoughts concrete and see.

Now granted, another persons opinion won't be the same as yours. But it'll help you swing your direction.

Last thing you want to do is spend over Â£600 and regret it, because it doesn't fit your lifestyle and how you use the device.

As for the reviewers... A quick overview at the start is grand. But a review is not possible after a day unless you're incredibly closed minded.

Likewise, I'll be posting a little overview at some point on my iPhone 6s. I should also do that about my Apple Watch...
