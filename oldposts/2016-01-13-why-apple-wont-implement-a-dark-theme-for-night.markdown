## iOS 9.3 Beta 1

Has bought us [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/). Built in to iOS and working right out the box without any hacky application or dodgy source code hiding... It's just... there.

Which is great! This is one of the things I missed about being jailbroken and it's finally there. I finally have no reason consider jailbreaking my device.

Yet, as always, people aren't happy...
