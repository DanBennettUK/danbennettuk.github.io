#Am I asking too much?

For my job, it's vital that I take notes of things going on. Whether it's work I'm doing or clients asking questions, notes are vital so that I can look back on them in the future in case something comes to bite me on the arse.

That's the main thing. Backing myself up so that I can prove to myself or others that something was the case.

I've mostly used Tomboy Notes. It's a lovely little application that automatically generates a daily note to go throughout that day and I have a seperate note with my todo list, which is always massive.

However, I've gotten into an issue where if I want to search for something, it's difficult. Each day is seperate. In a different note. It just takes twice as long as it should to find stuff.

A colleague of mine uses Amaya. It's an old but useful application that creates pages that are XHTML based. He uses it for doing a year logbook. Which is the most perfect idea ever!

The only issue, Amaya is old. It's no longer being activtly developed and has some really stupidly annoying issues. So I need something modern...

##Doesn't anyone care anymore?

Most people seem to be using Evernote or OneNote. I've tried both and I've hated them.

OneNote I fell out of love with very quickly. It's one of those apps that just never could sit right with me. It's got some really stupid shortcut placements (Try inserting the current time or date...) and if the note is too big it just gets a bit slow.

Same with Evernote. That is so slow and bulky. It's also very slow to load and everytime I paste some text in it seems to have a massive hissy fit on where my cursor is and mostly shows me the advertisements at the bottom. Oh and constantly begs me to purchase Evernote Premium. Feck off.

##Simplicity is key...

The great thing about Amaya is it's HTML. It's just one big HTML page which means I can easily CTRL + F and search for the words, date, time, month, foot I need. 

Also, because it doesn't need anything fancy. It's incredibly fast to use and viewing it is no hassle at all... 

It's still got some bulk to it for editing. I mean, it's essentially a Microsoft FrontPage application, just a lot better and less arse. But it's not made for note taking. It's made for webpage development.

##Compromise

I've currently settled for another simple Jekyll installation. I've got a very simple look and feel to it. All it needs is to open the HTML file and display it. 

Quotes from client emails are easily visible. I can easily link to things. I can easily insert code excerpts. It's great. Because it's all Markdown. 

The only downside with that, is I'm editing in Markdown. So I'm editing in a format that I cannot easily read as I can when reading the logbook itself.

It's a small compromise and with learning more about Markdown I'm sure I'd get used to it. But heck, why is there nothing that does this already?

##Say no to Web Apps!

Web Apps are a big no no. I want something I have control over. Web Apps bug the living shit out of me. Always have, always will. If I want to use an *application* I want to be able to have it in it's own little thing doing it's own little thing. I don't want it relying on Google fecking Chrome just to run. Especially when Chrome uses enough RAM as it is...

##Is this where I start to develop?

Maybe I need to just accept that no one works the way I want to. Or at least, no one has thought of it. Maybe I'm unique in the way I want to record how I do things. Surely I can't be alone? Can I?

Maybe it's about time I stop whinging that there's nothing and actually do something about it. Write a program that is universal, let's me do the things I want to do and pleases my every need. How hard can it be?

##Does everyone write Markdown in plain text?

That's another thing. I'm writing all my logs in Plain Text. But with Markdown... 

Has no one written an application that lets you write in Markdown, but on the fly displays it as HTML? That way you're typing away in Markdown and it's showing it as HTML? How you expect it to look?

No buggy Preview panes, no `jekyll serve` and double check everything's grand. Just... show me how it's meant to look as it's typing. Please?
