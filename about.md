Hi, I'm Dan Bennett!

For most my time, I work for an IT company hosting Moodle & Totara. I deal with the support side of things as well as the whole install/upgrade stuff!

Outside of work, I am a Music Producer. Focusing mostly on UK Hardcore, but also creating strange sounds within the Dance and Progressive range...
You can find some sounds I've done on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/danbennettuk).

I'm also a past Radio Presenter. It's something I really enjoyed and really want to get into again. So - if you work at a radio station... Hi? ;-)

### Contact me

Come say `Hello` on [Twitter] or by [E-Mail].
