# Season 6 Has Begun!

Today marks the start of our new /r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS Custom Game season!                       o

Join us to play some fun custom game modes in PUBG, have a laugh and make new friends!

Games such as *Mad Max Furgrounds* where you drive around trying to blow each other up and get those crossbow kills, or *King Of The Hill* which has just one zone (on a hill!) and instant death blue zone.
From Headshot only games, to silent games with the VSS and fog... and many modes submitted by the community!

[See the full list of modes here](https://goo.gl/JU1ds1).

## Winners

Congratulations to **Falco#9324** who is our Custom Games Season 5 Champion! Stealing the belt from Andy_#1034!

## Schedule

For our EU players, we play custom games on the following days:

 - Sunday at 19:00 UTC
 - Wednesday at 19:00 UTC
 - Friday at 19:00 UTC

For our NA players, trialling this season we are running NA games on the following day:

- Tuesday at 20:00 ET / 17:00 PT

We'll look at numbers and feedback for these NA games and hopefully next season we can introduce more days!

## Leaderboard

Both EU and NA games will run on the same [Custom Games leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/pubattlegrounds/wiki/customgamesindex).

We'll see how this goes for this season and feedback on this throughout the season is appreciated!

## Points

Like last season, we will be running this season on a points based system!

 - 1st place = 5 points
 - 2nd place = 3 points
 - 3rd place = 1 point.

## Custom Games

All games are now categorised by the type of game they are. So all Sniper based games are in their own category, as are Melee games.

Each host will now select two games from each category for the vote and the winner of each category will be played.

This will help prevent similar kind of modes being played which has been highly requested by the community.

We're still tinkering with the best category to place games, as some games can stray along two categories. Feedback on this would be appreciated!

## End of Season Tournament

The date for the next End of Season Tournament hasn't yet been decided.

We're considering before Christmas, but technically the last games of the season ends on New Years Eve.

I will be collecting feedback for the most ideal date. Please let me know your thoughts!
